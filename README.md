# shell-scripts
useful shell scripts

 - cabal-env.sh creates a ghci environment variable based on packages passed as arguments. this is mostly useless
 - far uses ripgrep and sed to replace strings using syntax `far /path/to/dir/ "oldstring" "newstring"`
 - scroat.sh is a screenshotting utility that will upload screenshots taken to imgur, print the url and delete hash, and use xdg-open to open the url in a web browser. shutter, scrot, and gnome-screenshot are all written into the script
 - shutdown.sh is a zennity dialogue that prompt for logout/suspend/shutdown etc. this is mostly for use with i3, but it's probably useful for other reasons
